# SS7 Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection for the [SS7 Attack
Simulator](https://github.com/polarking/jss7-attack-simulator) using the ELK
stack, Apache Kafka, and Apache Spark.

This project merge together each component required to run the SS7 Attack
Simulator and analysis its generated traffic using Apache Spark.

This project is part of a master thesis currently being done at NTNU Gj√∏vik,
Norway.

## Instructions
Clone the project using git:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/polarking/ss7-anomaly-detection
```

Please see the individual subproject's README.md for how to compile and run
each individual project.

1. Make sure Elasticsearch and Apache Kafka is running on localhost.
2. Create the Kafka topics *ss7-raw-input* and *ss7-preprocessed*, 
3. Start logstash, which reads network traffic on localhost using tshark: ```logstash -t logstash/tshark-kafka-es.conf```
4. Start the SS7 Attack Simulator following the instructions on the project
   page.
5. Start the ss7-ml-preprocess and the ss7-ml-analysis Spark applications
   following the instructions on the project pages.
6. After some time, data should start to appear in Elasticsearch.
